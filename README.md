File Encryption and Decryption using Node.js
This is a simple command-line program written in Node.js that allows you to encrypt and decrypt files using the AES-256-CBC encryption algorithm. 🔒🔑

Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine. 🖥️💻

Usage
- Clone the repository or download the files. 📂
- Navigate to the project directory in your terminal. 🖥️
- Run the program using the following command: node appx.js ⌨️
- Enter the file path of the file you want to encrypt/decrypt when prompted. 📂
- If you choose to encrypt a file, the program will generate a unique encryption key and initialization vector (IV) for that file. The encryption key and IV will be displayed on the screen. 🔑🔢
- If you choose to decrypt a file, you will need to enter the encryption key and IV that were generated when the file was encrypted. 🔑🔢

Note: This program is for educational purposes only. Do not use it to encrypt sensitive data without understanding the limitations of the encryption algorithm and the risks associated with storing the encryption key and IV. ⚠️
